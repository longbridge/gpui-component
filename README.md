We build multi-themes support in application, this feature is not including in GPUI Component. It is based on `Theme` feature, so it easy to do.

## Usage

GPUI and GPUI Component still in development, so we need add dependency by git.

And GPUI Component depends on `gpui` by special version (It keep updated to upstream) for including WebView support.

```toml
gpui = { git = "https://github.com/huacnlee/zed.git", branch = "webview" }
gpui-component = { git = "https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component.git" }
```

### WebView

GPUI Component have `WebView` element based on [Wry](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), this is an optional feature, you can enable it by feature flag.

```toml
gpui-component = { git = "https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component.git", features = ["webview"] }
```

More usage can be found in [story](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component/tree/main/crates/story) directory.

### Icons

GPUI Component have `Icon` element, but it does not include SVG files by default.

The example is using [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icons, but you can use any icons you like, just named the svg files like [IconName](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component/blob/main/crates/ui/src/icon.rs#L86) defined the path name.
You can add icons that you need in your project.
