        After experiencing a turbulent period of user loss and advertiser
        withdrawal, the prospects for social media company X seem to be
        brightening.

        According to Bloomberg,
        <strong
            >X is currently in negotiations for a new round of financing with
            investors, with a valuation of up to $44 billion, which is the price
            Musk paid to acquire the company in 2022.</strong

        Investors include well-known institutions such as Andreessen Horowitz,
        Sequoia Capital, and the Qatar Investment Authority. The report cites
        informed sources indicating that negotiations are still ongoing, details
        may change, and the company may also abandon the financing plan.
        Notably, this is the first time X has sought external investment since
        Musk privatized Twitter.

        Interpretations of X's financing prospects vary. Although many users and
        advertisers chose to leave after Musk took over, the company's valuation
        remains at $44 billion, reflecting market expectations for a turnaround
        in the future.

        Despite the numerous challenges facing X, Musk's personal political
        influence seems to be bringing new opportunities to his business empire.
        Since Trump's election, Tesla's stock price has risen by more than 40%.
        SpaceX's latest valuation has reached $350 billion, making it the
        largest tech startup in the world. Additionally, Musk's artificial
        intelligence company xAI is seeking financing at a valuation of about
        $75 billion.

            >Some analysts believe that Musk's close relationship with the Trump
            administration has changed investors' perceptions of X's
            prospects.</strong
        >
        Some investors are betting that Musk's political role will help advance
        his business interests.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previously, Fidelity Investments had written down its investment in X by
        about 70%, lowering it from the $44 billion transaction price. However,
        recently Morgan Stanley has been selling $3 billion of X's debt at face
        value without any discount, indicating a significant rebound in investor
        demand.
