# Root View

The [Root] component for as the root provider of GPUI Component features in a window. We must to use [Root] as the **first level child** of a window to enable GPUI Component features.

This is important, if we don't use [Root] as the first level child of a window, there will have some unexpected behaviors.

```rs
fn main() {
    let app = Application::new();

    app.run(move |cx| {
        // This must be called before using any GPUI Component features.
        gpui_component::init(cx);

        cx.spawn(async move |cx| {
            cx.open_window(WindowOptions::default(), |window, cx| {
                let view = cx.new(|_| Example);
                // This first level on the window, should be a Root.
                cx.new(|cx| Root::new(view.into(), window, cx))
            })?;

            Ok::<_, anyhow::Error>(())
        })
        .detach();
    });
}
```
